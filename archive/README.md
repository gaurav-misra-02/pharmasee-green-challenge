# Archive

This directory contains the original code files from the initial development phase.

## Files

- **demo.py** - Original demo with syntax error (incomplete case statement)
- **demo1.py** - Working version of original demo
- **ocr_tester.py** - Simple OCR testing script
- **tester_code.py** - Experimental deep learning approach (incomplete)

These files have been archived as they contained:
- Hard-coded Windows file paths
- Debug breakpoints
- Syntax errors
- Non-standard naming conventions

The functionality has been refactored and improved in the `src/` directory with:
- Clean code structure
- Proper error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility
- LLM integration
- Modern Python practices
